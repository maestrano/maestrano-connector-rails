    # ==> Environment configuration
    # The environment to connect to.
    # If set to 'production' then all Single Sign-On (SSO) and API requests
    # will be made to maestrano.com
    # If set to 'test' then requests will be made to api-sandbox.maestrano.io
    # The api-sandbox allows you to easily test integration scenarios.

    # used to redirect users to the right SAML url during SSO handshake.
    #
    config.app.host = Settings.app_host

    # ==> App ID & API key
    # Your application App ID and API key which you can retrieve on http://maestrano.com
    # via your cloud partner dashboard.
    # For testing you can retrieve/generate an api.id and api.key from the API Sandbox directly

    #
    # config.sso.enabled = true

    # ==> Single Sign-On Identity Manager
    # By default we consider that the domain managing user identification
    # is the same as your application host (see above config.app.host parameter)
    # If you have a dedicated domain managing user identification and therefore
    # responsible for the single sign-on handshake (e.g: https://idp.my-app.com)
    # then you can specify it below
    #
    # config.sso.idm = (config.environment == 'production' ? 'https://idp.my-app.com' : 'http://localhost:3000')

    # ==> SSO Initialization endpoint
    # This is your application path to the SAML endpoint that allows users to
    # initialize SSO authentication. Upon reaching this endpoint users your
    # application will automatically create a SAML request and redirect the user
    # to Maestrano. Maestrano will then authenticate and authorize the user. Upon
    # authorization the user gets redirected to your application consumer endpoint
    # (see below) for initial setup and/or login.
    #
    # The controller for this path is automatically
    # generated when you run 'rake maestrano:install' and is available at
    # <rails_root>/app/controllers/maestrano/auth/saml.rb
    #
    config.sso.init_path = Settings[tenant][:sso_init_path]

    # ==> SSO Consumer endpoint
    # This is your application path to the SAML endpoint that allows users to
    # finalize SSO authentication. During the 'consume' action your application
    # sets users (and associated group) up and/or log them in.
    #
    # The controller for this path is automatically
    # generated when you run 'rake maestrano:install' and is available at
    # <rails_root>/app/controllers/maestrano/auth/saml.rb
    #

    # ==> Single Logout activation
    # Enable/Disable single logout. When troubleshooting authentication issues
    # you might want to disable SLO temporarily.
    # If set to false then Maestrano::SSO::Session#valid? - which should be
    # used in a controller before filter to check user session - always return true
    #
    # config.sso.slo_enabled = true

    # ==> SSO User creation mode
    # !IMPORTANT
    # On Maestrano users can take several "instances" of your service. You can consider
    # each "instance" as 1) a billing entity and 2) a collaboration group (this is
    # equivalent to a 'customer account' in a commercial world). When users login to
    # your application via single sign-on they actually login via a specific group which
    # is then supposed to determine which data they have access to inside your application.
    #
    # E.g: John and Jack are part of group 1. They should see the same data when they login to
    # your application (employee info, analytics, sales etc..). John is also part of group 2
    # but not Jack. Therefore only John should be able to see the data belonging to group 2.
    #
    # In most application this is done via collaboration/sharing/permission groups which is
    # why a group is required to be created when a new user logs in via a new group (and
    # also for billing purpose - you charge a group, not a user directly).
    #
    # == mode: 'real'
    # In an ideal world a user should be able to belong to several groups in your application.
    # In this case you would set the 'sso.creation_mode' to 'real' which means that the uid
    # and email we pass to you are the actual user email and maestrano universal id.
    #
    # == mode: 'virtual'
    # Now let's say that due to technical constraints your application cannot authorize a user
    # to belong to several groups. Well next time John logs in via a different group there will
    # be a problem: the user already exists (based on uid or email) and cannot be assigned
    # to a second group. To fix this you can set the 'sso.creation_mode' to 'virtual'. In this
    # mode users get assigned a truly unique uid and email across groups. So next time John logs
    # in a whole new user account can be created for him without any validation problem. In this
    # mode the email we assign to him looks like "usr-sdf54.cld-45aa2@mail.maestrano.com". But don't
    # worry we take care of forwarding any email you would send to this address
    #
    # config.sso.creation_mode = 'real' # or 'virtual'

    # ==> Account Webhooks
    # Single sign on has been setup into your app and Maestrano users are now able
    # to use your service. Great! Wait what happens when a business (group) decides to
    # stop using your service? Also what happens when a user gets removed from a business?
    # Well the endpoints below are for Maestrano to be able to notify you of such
    # events.
    #
    # Even if the routes look restful we issue only issue DELETE requests for the moment
    # to notify you of any service cancellation (group deletion) or any user being
    # removed from a group.
    #
    # The controllers for these hooks path are automatically generated when
    # you run 'rake maestrano:install' and is available under
    # <rails_root>/app/controllers/maestrano/account/
